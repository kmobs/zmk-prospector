      Enable this option when using ESB (Enhanced ShockBurst) communication protocol.
      ESB does not pass battery status from peripherals, so this disables the
      battery label and USB/BLE output status widgets, providing more space
      for the animation.

      Controls how quickly lines fade out (opacity) after you stop typing.
      Shorter values = faster fade, longer values = lines linger more.
      Animation freezes at 10% of this time.

config PROSPECTOR_ANIMATION_FLOW_DECAY_SEC

    help
      Controls how long lines maintain their direction and length.
      Lines gradually return to idle angle and shrink over this period.
      Longer values = more persistent flowing and length effect.
